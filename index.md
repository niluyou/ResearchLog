# Welcome to My Research Page

Hi! I’m Niloufar Yousefi, a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at the University of Toronto.  
My research focuses on **estimator-based feedback optimization** for dynamical systems.  

Here, you’ll find my project notes, papers, code, and progress updates.

Feel free to explore the repository and get in touch!
